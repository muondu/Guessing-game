## If you got it correct
This is a gesing game. The computer will chose a random number and the user must try and guess the number. If it is correct, it will show the number  and then say it is correct. Then it will ask you if you want to try again. If you say yes, it will repeat the same thing. If no, it will say goodbye.

## If you got it wrong
On the other hand, if you guess it wrong, it will show you the number and then it will ask you if you want to give up. If you type yes, it will say better lack next time but if you say no, it will contninue.
